- Modifications: Since phase A, we've gone back and editted out questions based on feedback we recieved. We've also modified them slightly based on our own discretion in order to make them more complex and easier to visualize.
We also made some modifications to our questions to accept input from the user because most/all of our questions did not accept input previously. This means we also adjusted some of our queries from Phase D.

- Process - not many updates were made since phase C. It is as listed below.
Producing table data:
In order to produce the data used in our tables, we ran a script to process and add additional data to the database from csv files downloaded from the links below.
It can be found here: https://github.com/room-projector/Snyk-Crawler
Follow the instructions in the README.md file to run the script and reproduce our data.
For much of the data we needed to remove all columns in the csv files that were not needed for our tables determined from our ER diagram.

The columns we kept for each of the csv files is listed as below:
Sucide: Period, Location, Dim1, FactValueNumeric renamed to be year, country, sex, and age_standardized_suicide_rates respectively.
Psychiatrists count (renamed to Country): Location, ParentLocation, Value renamed to be name, region, and psychiatrist_count respectively.
Outpatient: Location, Period renamed to be country and year respectively. An additional column mental_health_allocation was added to the csv file to increase table complexity.
General Hospital: Location, Period renamed to be country and year respectively. Additional columns rehabilitation_count, mental_health_allocation, and mental_health_prescription_count were added to the csv file to increase table complexity.
Day Treatment: Location, Period renamed to be country and year respectively. Additional columns closing_hour, non_drug_alc_count, and drug_alc_count were added to the csv file to increase table complexity.
Mental Hospital: Location, Period renamed to be country and year respectively. Additional columns ptsd_count,depression_count, and insanity_count were added to the csv file to increase table complexity.
While processing each of the types of facilities (Outpatient, General Hospital, Day Treatment, and Mental Hospital), we created a facility and patient ledger parent tuple for each of the facilities.
Facility: was created with columns the Location, FactValueNumeric, and Period attributes of each Facility type tuple. An additional type attribute was added to the Facility tuple to indicate the type of facility. Finally, avg_stay and cost columns were added to increase table complexity.
Patient Ledger: was created with Location and Period attributes of each Facility tuple. An additional type attribute was added to the Patient Ledger tuple to indicate the type of facility. Finally, cost, diagnoses_count, and patient_count columns were added to increase table complexity.

Running startup script:
Connect to a ugrad machine.
Clone the repo mentioned above and cd into the processed folder. 
Connect to your MariaDB database.
From there, run "\. startup.sql" to run the startup script, "\. startup-small.sql" to run the small startup script, and "\. cleanup.sql" to run the cleanup script.

The links we used to download much of the initial csv data are found below:

- Successes: We were able to use multiple types of graphs available on CanvasJS to display our information (standard bar graphs, pie chart, combined bar graphs, etc.). Although not really anything to brag about, this is the first time we've used PHP and SQL, so being able to execute and display these queries was a success for us.
Being able to write procedures and connect html, php, and sql together in order to query and visualize our data was a success for us. 

- Known Issues: none

- Extensions: Finding additional sources of information to display, as there are so many more aspects to mental health that can be explored, such as affects on life at school or work, or what factors contribute to worse mental health. If we had more time, we could also find better ways to visualize the data using CanvasJS, or apply ML algorithms to run unsupervised learning to find patterns in mental health. Something else that we could do is making the landing page more appealing than just a drop down with menu items.
